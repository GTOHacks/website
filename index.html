					<h2>The Theme</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>For GTOHacks 2024, our theme will be studying. Participants will create a program to assist students in their studying. Key problems surrounding this topic may include procrastination, burnout, and information retention. In the name of fairness, a detailed case will be revealed on the first day so no team has an advantage.</p>
